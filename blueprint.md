# Blueprint: Paw Patrol Maze Adventure

## Overview

This document outlines the design and features of the Paw Patrol Maze Adventure game. The game is an interactive maze where the user guides a character from a starting point on the left to an endpoint on the right. The application is designed to be responsive, accessible, and visually engaging for a young audience.

## Current Implementation

### Core Gameplay

*   **Random Maze Generation:** Mazes are generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm, ensuring a new experience every time.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Users can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy (8x8), Medium (12x12), and Hard (16x16). The maze maintains a consistent, large size across all difficulty levels.
*   **Controls:** 
    *   **Keyboard:** Players can use the arrow keys for precise, one-square-at-a-time movement.
    *   **Touchscreen:** Players can trace a path with their finger in real-time. The character follows the touch path fluidly and instantly, providing a smooth and intuitive "painting" experience.
*   **Goal:** The objective is to guide the character from the start (left edge) to the end (right edge). The start and end points are randomized along the edges for replayability.

### Visual & Interactive Features

*   **Paw Patrol Theme:** The game features Paw Patrol characters (Chase, Rubble, Skye, Marshall, Zuma) to create an engaging experience for kids.
*   **Rainbow Path Tracing:** The player's path is traced with a vibrant, multi-colored rainbow effect, making it easy to see where they've been.
*   **Dynamic Layout:** The application layout dynamically adjusts to the true visible area of the browser window, eliminating scrollbars caused by browser UI elements. The header and controls are compact and efficient, maximizing space for the game itself.
*   **Responsive Design:** The maze layout intelligently adapts to the screen size and orientation, ensuring a great experience on any device.
*   **Congratulations Modal:** A celebratory modal with Paw Patrol characters appears when the maze is solved.
*   **Optimized Performance:** The game is optimized for smooth performance, with fast touch response and snappy animations.

### File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main landing page with a modern, dark theme and links to the games.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the `index.html` page.
*   `maze_rectangle.html`: The main file for the maze game, containing all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Character Selection:** Allow the user to choose their favorite Paw Patrol pup as the player character.
*   **Sound Effects:** Add fun sound effects for movement, completing the maze, and button clicks.
*   **Animations:** Animate the Paw Patrol characters to make them more lively.
*   **More Games:** Add more games to the arcade, such as Tic-Tac-Toe.
