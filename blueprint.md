# Multi-Maze Adventure Blueprint

## 1. Overview

This project has been reorganized into two distinct applications to improve maintainability and prevent code conflicts.

1.  **Multi-Maze - Rectangle:** A web-based maze game application offering a variety of themed rectangular mazes. Its files are prefixed with `multi_maze_rectangle`.
2.  **Multi-Maze - Circle:** A dedicated application for the experimental circular maze. Its files are prefixed with `multi_maze_circle`.

Both applications are linked from the main `index.html` arcade page.

## 2. Implemented Features, Styles, and Design

*   **Main Arcade Menu:** A responsive menu with cards for selecting different games.
*   **Multi-Maze - Rectangle:**
    *   A robust and functional rectangular maze generator.
    *   Keyboard and touch controls for player movement.
    *   Themed mazes: "Everyone Maze", "Paw Patrol Maze", "Gabby Maze", and "Zog Maze".
    *   Character selection for each theme.
    *   Difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard).
    *   Win modal with character images.
*   **Multi-Maze - Circle:**
    *   A functional circular maze web component.
    *   Layer selection (4, 5, or 6 layers).
    *   Themed with "Everyone" characters.

## 3. Completed Task: Separate and Refine Maze Applications (2024-07-26)

*   **Task:** Formally separate the rectangular and circular maze games into their own files and update the main arcade to reflect this change. Expand the rectangular maze game with new content.
*   **Status:** Completed.

*   **Execution Log:**
    1.  **Updated Blueprint:** Documented the file naming convention.
    2.  **Separated Files:**
        *   Created `multi_maze_rectangle.html`, `multi_maze_rectangle.css`, and `multi_maze_rectangle.js` for the rectangular maze game.
        *   Created `multi_maze_circle.html`, `multi_maze_circle.css`, and `multi_maze_circle.js` for the circular maze game.
        *   Deleted the original `multi_maze.html`, `multi_maze.css`, and `multi_maze.js` files.
    3.  **Refactored Rectangular Maze Application:**
        *   Updated file links in `multi_maze_rectangle.html`.
        *   Removed all code related to the circle maze.
        *   Added "Gabby Maze" and "Zog Maze" themes by updating `themes.js`.
        *   Added new buttons in `multi_maze_rectangle.html` and event listeners in `multi_maze_rectangle.js` for the new themes.
    4.  **Refactored Circle Maze Application:**
        *   Created a clean structure in `multi_maze_circle.html` to run the circle maze component.
        *   Moved circle-specific styles to `multi_maze_circle.css`.
        *   Created `multi_maze_circle.js` to handle theme and layer selection for the circle maze.
    5.  **Updated Main Arcade (`index.html`):**
        *   Renamed the "Multi Maze" link to "Multi-Maze - Rectangle".
        *   Added a new "Multi-Maze - Circle" link.
