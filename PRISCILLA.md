## Games [NOT IN ORDER OF THE MENU (INDEX) WHICH IS CONFUSING, COUNTING GAME IS MISSING FROM THIS LIST?? AND THE COUNTING GAME HAS A LIST OF IMPROVEMENTS SOMEWHERE - THIS ALL NEEDS TO BE RE-DONE - IN THE ORDER OF THE INDEX = AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE GAMES NEED TO BE EXPLICIT - THE 3 MAZE GAMES FOR EXAMPLE ARE IN A WAY VERSIONS OF THE SAME THING, THE 2 RECTANGLULAR ONES THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS CHARATOR SELECTIONS - SO PERHAPS LIFE WOULD BE EASIER IF WE HAD ONE VERSION WITH A SELECTION FROM : ALLCHARACTORS, PAW PATROL, GABBY, AND ZOG(I WILL ADD MORE IMAGES TO THAT FOLDER) - ALSO THE CIRCLE MAZE COULD BE A SELECTION ALSO - "SHAPE = RECTANGLE OR CIRLE" IF WE ARE TO GO DOWN THIS PATH WE NEED TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING CODE (AS MUCH OF IT WORKS AND IS IN USE) AND CREATE A MAZE_MASTER GAME AND START OVER USING EXISTING CODE AS A START POINT = PLEASE HELP REFINE THIS BY SUGGESTING / COMMENTING - IS THIS A BAD IDEA? ]
