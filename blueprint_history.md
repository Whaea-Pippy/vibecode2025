# Blueprint History: Kids' Arcade Games

This file will track all future development tasks for the project.

A complete archive of all previous project history can be found in `blueprint_archive.md`.

## Game Consolidation: Phase 1 (September 27, 2025)

*   **Goal:** Begin the consolidation of the three maze games into a single `multi_maze` application.
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Ported the **Classic Maze Adventure** to the new `multi_maze` application.
    *   **HTML:** Extracted the game structure from `v1_games/maze_rectangle.html` and placed it in `multi_maze.html`.
    *   **CSS:** Extracted the styles and placed them in `multi_maze.css`.
    *   **JavaScript:** Extracted the game logic, encapsulated it, and placed it in `multi_maze.js`.
    *   Added menu navigation to switch between the main menu and the Classic Maze game.

## Archive Maintenance (September 27, 2025)

*   **Goal:** Ensure the archived games in the `v1_games` directory are self-contained and playable.
*   **Problem:** The archived games had broken image links because they were referencing the root `images` directory.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Copied the entire `images` directory into the `v1_games` directory.
    *   This action fixed the broken image paths and made the archived games fully functional again.

## Blueprint Refactoring (September 27, 2025)

*   **Goal:** Correct the project blueprint to accurately reflect the current development plan.
*   **Problem:** The previous blueprint was incorrect and did not reflect the user's stated goal of consolidating the three maze games into a single `multi_maze` application. The AI assistant failed to properly record the user's instructions.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Located the correct plan in the `blueprint_archive.md` file.
    *   Updated the `blueprint.md` file with the correct plan, including the explicit instruction to use the `v1_games` directory as a reference only.
