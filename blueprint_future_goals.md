## Archived Game Enhancements

### 🐞 Circle Maze (`v1_games/maze_circle.html`)
*   **Bug:** Images are too small.
*   **Bug:** The maze layout is confusing for young children.

*   **Bug:** The touch screen trace functionality does not work.

### 🐞 Paw Patrol Maze (`v1_games/maze_paw_patrol.html`)
*   **Bug:** This maze has the same underlying bugs as the original Classic Maze (e.g., character can move through walls).
